# About this repository

This repository contains samples of work from my time at Google, where I was hired as a contracted technical writer for Learning Experience Lab (LXL), a then-new team that sought to drive adoption of Google's developer technology through educational documentation. 

Rather than embed with any particular product area (PA), LXL functioned like an internal agency that worked across all of Google's developer PAs, including Android, Google Chrome, Google Maps Platform, Google Pay, and Google I/O. 

As a result, this role required me to drop into different PAs, quickly establish relationships with stakeholders and learn their technologies, and then write or edit the requested documentation.

For samples of my writing, see the [`writing_samples.md`](writing_samples.md) file. 

For samples of my editing, see the [`editing_samples.md`](editing_samples.md) file.
